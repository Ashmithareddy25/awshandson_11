---

## üìò Overview
This project demonstrates how **Amazon Athena** can be used to analyze e-commerce sales data directly from Amazon S3.  
Using **AWS Glue**, the dataset was crawled and structured into an Athena table, allowing SQL queries to be executed without the need for provisioning servers.  

The queries explore sales patterns, regional loss ‚Äúhotspots‚Äù, discount effects, product profitability rankings, and monthly growth trends.
